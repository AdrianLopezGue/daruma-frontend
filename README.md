## About the project
This repository holds my final year project during my time at the University of Córdoba titled "Daruma, shared expenses management system" built with NestJS framework.

The purpose of this project is to learn new technologies like NestJS and Flutter and apply concepts about Software Desing like Domain-Driven-Desing, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Clean code, unit, integration and End-to-End testing, etc.

Daruma allows users to easily manage shared expenses made in a group, including the management of recurring expenses like Netflix, HBO, etc...



## Key Features

* **State management**: Redux, BloC, repository patterns .
* **Backend connection**: API provider pattern.
* **Invitation to group member**: Firebase Dynamic Links.
